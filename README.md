# Machine Learning Models Project Collection

A comprehensive collection of projects applying various classical Machine Learning algorithms to different datasets.

## Overview

This repository showcases implementation of different Machine Learning models from scratch as well as using libraries like **scikit-learn**.  
Each project explores a different ML algorithm applied on sample datasets, including model training, evaluation, and visualization.


## ML Models Covered

- **Decision Tree Classifier**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**

Each model folder includes:
- Model building script
- Data preprocessing (if necessary)
- Model training and testing
- Accuracy score and evaluation metrics
- Graphical plots (confusion matrix, decision boundaries where applicable)


## ðŸ§  Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab (optional)
