# Machine Learning Models Project Collection

A comprehensive collection of projects applying various classical Machine Learning algorithms to different datasets.

## Overview

This repository showcases implementation of different Machine Learning models from scratch as well as using libraries like **scikit-learn**.  
Each project explores a different ML algorithm applied on sample datasets, including model training, evaluation, and visualization.
